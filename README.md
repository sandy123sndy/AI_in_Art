# AI_in_Art
In this era of automation everything around us being automatic. wherever you go, be it technical or non-technical sector, you are going to find something working automatic. Similarly, AI is making its path in the field of music, art and in a lot more creative domains. So, yes AI is being more intelligent to learn how to be creative. Now, here in this project I have used an algorithm, introduced by Google, to produce several new images from the mixture of two images. This algorithm is known as 'Deep Dream Algorithm'. 
Now, Firstly, I have used two images and blended those to produce an hybrid image, which is mixture of the two. Then, I have passed that image through the Inception net and made a 'gradient ascent' so that the features in the deeper layers can be focused on and we can have several patterns of the image. The more deeper we go, the more different patterns will get revealed.
Atlast, I have just accumulated those images into a video, so that we can see the change happening due to different patterns.
